# Willis Towers Watson Front End Developer â€“ Assessment Project

## Setup Dependencies

`npm install`

Will install all dependencies required for the project.

## Run project

`npm start`

Will run the project and show locally at http://localhost:3000

Since there is no backend this is all you will need to run/view the project.

## Testing

`npm run test`

Tests are inside of their respective component folder.

Since I have little experience with end to end testing all of the tests here will be unit tests, testing the functionality of individual components and their respective functions.
